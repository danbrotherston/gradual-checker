This directory contains the SVG files used for the diagrams in the Checker
Framework manual.

SVG can be edited using a variety of tools, such as Inkscape, Visio and
OpenOffice. The HTML manual uses the SVGs directly. The PDF manual uses
PDF conversions of each SVG.

Most modern browsers support SVG. Here is a list of browsers that support it:
http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg

To include an image in your chapter, use for example:

\includeimage{formatter-hierarchy}{3.5cm}
or
\includeimagenocentering{value-subtyping}{2.75cm}

Note the absence of the SVG extension. Note that the size parameter is the
*vertical* size for the PDF only, not the HTML. To affect the size of an
image in HTML, please edit the image size in the SVG directly.

To create a new image, please copy an existing SVG and make modifications
to it, so that the boxes and arrows you create have the same size and font
as in other SVGs. Please edit the Makefile accordingly for your new image.

NOTE: In some cases dia will not properly convert an SVG to an EPS. Always
make sure the EPS that is generated looks good in the PDF version of the
manual before pushing your changes. If the EPS doesn't look good, please
manually export the SVG into an EPS and include it in this directory,
and do not include it in the list of EPSFILES in the Makefile. Do however
include in the list of PDFFILES in the Makefile so that a PDF will be
generated by epstopdf. Also, *make sure* you include a line in the Makefile
indicating that nothing should be done for that EPS file. Otherwise it
will be overwritten by dia. See value-subtyping.eps in the Makefile for
an example of this.

Please do not add any PNG files to this directory as they will be deleted
by the Makefile.

The tool you use to edit SVGs should have an option to export to EPS. If
it doesn't, Inkscape can do this.
